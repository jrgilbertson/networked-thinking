# Weekly Review

Week beginning {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} (review Sun-Sat).

*The below is Jason's weekly review template. We recommend modifying for what works best for you. The `Personal Strategy and OKRs` references are a structure note with quarterly OKRs and personal values and goals.*

## Last Week

**TL;DR:** 1-3 sentence overview of last week's theme.

### Recurring Blockers Mitigation

1. Blocker → default mitigation → time-bound fallback

### System Health & Alerts

1. **Top friction this week:** [One tool/process/habit that created friction, or "none"]
2. **Energy/morale driver:** [What most affected your energy or morale - positive or negative]

**Metric alerts (analyze only if triggered):**

- Morale <6 for 2+ weeks → Root cause? Structural change needed?
- Energy <6 for 2+ weeks → What's draining energy?
- Deep work <12h for 2+ weeks → What's blocking focus?
- Same blocker 2+ weeks → Why isn't mitigation working? Different approach?

**If alert triggered:** Add addressing root cause to this week's objectives.

### Asks

What help, support, or resources would be valuable this week? (optional)
