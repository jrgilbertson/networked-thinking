# Thinking and Learning

## Philosophy

1. [[202504231231 The Stoic dichotomy of control divides reality into things we can control—our judgments, desires, and actions—and things we cannot, such as external events, other people, and outcomes]]

## Spaced Repetition

1. [[202509010952 Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention]]
2. [[202509010956 The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve is a model showing how memory retention declines exponentially over time if there is no attempt to review the learned information]]
