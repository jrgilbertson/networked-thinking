# Networked Thinking

A companion vault for the book "Networked Thinking" (coming 2026). This Obsidian vault demonstrates a methodology for building a sustainable personal knowledge management system that works with how you actually think—and how AI tools process information.

## Why This System?

### The Problem with Traditional Knowledge Management

Most knowledge management systems fail because they optimize for collecting rather than understanding. Tags proliferate into chaos. Folders force artificial hierarchies on networked information. You save everything but understand nothing. Even sophisticated systems like Zettelkasten need adaptation for our digital, AI-enhanced world.

### The Networked Thinking Solution

This methodology addresses these fundamental issues through three core practices:

1. **Curate**: Practice selective capture based on clear criteria. Not everything deserves to be saved. Our 5W framework (What for? Why now? What else? Who from? Where to?) ensures each piece of information earns its place through genuine utility.
2. **Connect**: Build explicit relationships between ideas using aliases, backlinks, and structure notes. Knowledge forms networks, not hierarchies. Multiple pathways to the same concept mirror how memory works and how AI processes information.
3. **Cultivate**: Maintain a living system through consistent practices. Notes evolve as understanding deepens. Connections strengthen through use. The system becomes more valuable over time through active tending.

## What's Included

## Five Principles for Human-AI Collaboration

1. **Atomic thinking with consistent structure**: One idea per note with internal organization supporting both human understanding and machine parsing
2. **Selective curation using explicit criteria**: Information must be worth your future self's time
3. **Explicit connections through aliases and links**: Relationships between ideas must be visible and navigable
4. **Natural language for broad accessibility**: Clear writing that humans understand is what AI systems can process
5. **Evolution through active maintenance**: Notes should reflect growing understanding, not remain static

## Getting Started

1. **Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**: Download the free, local-first knowledge management app.
2. **Clone or download this repository**: Get the complete vault structure with all templates and examples.
3. **Open the folder as a vault in Obsidian**: Select File → Open Vault → Choose the networked-thinking folder.
4. **Follow the [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md) guide**: Complete the 30-minute hands-on introduction to create your first atomic note.

## Key Features

- **Timestamp-based naming**: Every atomic note uses YYYYMMDDHHMM format to ensure uniqueness and chronological ordering.
- **Consistent note structure**: Templates provide reliable starting points for processing information across all note types.
- **Multiple navigation paths**: Find information through aliases, tags, backlinks, and structure notes instead of rigid hierarchies.
- **Minimal plugin dependencies**: The system works with core Obsidian features for long-term sustainability and portability.
- **Git-friendly plain text**: All notes are markdown files that work seamlessly with version control and collaboration tools.
- **AI-compatible structure**: Consistent formatting and explicit connections enable AI tools to navigate and enhance your knowledge system.

## Philosophy

This system works because it aligns with cognitive science research on how humans process and retain information. When you write in your own words, create explicit connections, and regularly review and refine, you engage the mechanisms that create lasting understanding.

The AI compatibility isn't coincidental. Large language models process information through patterns and relationships—exactly what this methodology makes explicit. Your knowledge system becomes a thinking partner that both you and AI tools can navigate effectively.
