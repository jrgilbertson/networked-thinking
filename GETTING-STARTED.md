# Getting Started Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through exploring and using the Networked Thinking system. By the end, you'll understand how to create, connect, and cultivate your own knowledge network.

## Before You Begin

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Obsidian installed and opened
- [ ] This vault loaded in Obsidian
- [ ] 30 minutes of focused time

**What You'll Accomplish:**
- Explore the existing knowledge network
- Create your first atomic note
- Connect it to the system
- Set up your daily workflow

## Part 1: Explore the System (10 minutes)

### Start with the Main Hub

1. **Open the Networked Thinking System structure note**
	- Located in `Structure Notes/` folder
	- This is your main navigation hub
	- Click through 2-3 linked atomic notes to see how concepts connect

### Understand the Core Components

2. **Explore an Atomic Note**
	- Notice the timestamp format (YYYYMMDDHHMM)
	- See the DAE structure: Definition, Analogy, Example
	- Check the aliases and connections at the bottom

3. **Follow a Connection**
	- Click a link to another note
	- Notice how concepts build on each other
	- Use the backlinks panel to see what links here

### See the Organization

4. **Browse the Structure Notes**
	- Each one is a topic map for related concepts
	- Notice how some atomic notes appear in multiple structures
	- This is intentional—knowledge is networked, not hierarchical

## Part 2: Create Your First Atomic Note (15 minutes)

### Choose Your Concept

1. **Think of something you learned recently**
	- A concept from work
	- An insight from reading
	- A pattern you've noticed

	Ask yourself: "What's the ONE core idea here?"

### Use the Template

2. **Create a new note from template**
	- Click the "Create new note" button
	- Apply the `Templates/Atomic Note Template`
	- Name it: `YYYYMMDDHHMM Your concept in a complete sentence.md`
	- Example: `202501151430 Compound interest applies to knowledge not just money.md`

### Fill in the Structure

3. **Write your note using DAE**
	- **Definition** (20-60 words): Explain the concept in your own words
	- **Analogy**: Compare it to something familiar
	- **Example**: Give a concrete instance

4. **Add metadata**
	- Add 2-3 aliases (other ways you might search for this)
	- Link to related notes if any exist (it's OK if none do yet)

### Connect to the System

5. **Add to a Structure Note**
	- Open the most relevant structure note
	- Add a link to your new atomic note

## Part 3: Set Up Your Workflow (5 minutes)

### Configure Daily Notes

1. **Set up the hotkey**
	- Settings → Hotkeys → Search "daily note"
	- Set to something memorable (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + D)
	- Test it to create today's daily note

### Establish Your Rhythm

2. **Morning Capture (5 minutes)**
	- Open daily note
	- Capture thoughts, tasks, ideas in the Inbox section
	- Don't process yet—just capture

3. **Evening Process (10 minutes)**
	- Review the day's captures
	- Convert worthy items to atomic notes
	- Link and connect
	- Delete the rest without guilt

### Schedule Weekly Review

4. **Pick your review day**
	- Add a recurring calendar reminder
	- Use the Weekly Review template
	- Focus: patterns, connections, pruning

## Quick Start Checklist

**Right Now:**
- [ ] Create your first daily note (Cmd/Ctrl + D)
- [ ] Capture one thought or learning
- [ ] Create one atomic note from it

**This Week:**
- [ ] Create one atomic note per day
- [ ] Add each to a structure note
- [ ] Do your first weekly review

**This Month:**
- [ ] Build 20-30 atomic notes
- [ ] Create your own structure note for a topic you're learning
- [ ] Start seeing connections emerge

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know if something deserves to be an atomic note?**
A: Use the 5W framework: What for? Why now? What else? Who from? Where to? If it passes 3+ questions, it's worth capturing.

**Q: What if I can't find connections to other notes?**
A: We discourage orphan notes—every atomic note should have at least one home. If your new note doesn't fit existing structure notes, that's a signal to create a new structure note for this emerging topic. Even if it starts with just one atomic note, the structure note ensures discoverability and provides a place for related notes to gather as your understanding grows.

**Q: Should I import my existing notes?**
A: No. Start fresh. Only bring in notes as you need to reference them, rewriting them in atomic format.

**Q: How many structure notes should I have?**
A: Start with the three provided. Create new ones whenever you have atomic notes that don't fit existing structures—even if it's just one note on a new topic. This prevents orphans and creates space for related notes to gather.

## What's Next?

### Coming Soon

- **Workflow Examples**: We're developing detailed examples of daily capture, weekly review, and meeting note workflows
- **AI Integration Guide**: Prompts and patterns for using AI with your vault
- **Advanced Techniques**: Cross-referencing, emergence recognition, and more

### Continue Learning

- Explore the other two structure notes (Thinking and Learning, System Design)
- Read through existing atomic notes for examples
- Review the templates to understand different note types
- Check the reference note to see how to process sources

### Remember

- **Start small**: One note per day is better than ten rushed notes
- **Use your own words**: Rewriting creates understanding
- **Trust the process**: Connections emerge naturally over time
- **Stay curious**: The best notes come from genuine interest
