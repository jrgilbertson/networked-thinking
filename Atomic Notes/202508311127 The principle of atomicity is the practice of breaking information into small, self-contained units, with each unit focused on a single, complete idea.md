# Principle of Atomicity

The principle of atomicity is the practice of breaking information into small, self-contained units, with each unit focused on a single, complete idea. This approach creates [[202508311132 Modularity is a software design principle that involves dividing a program into separate, independent modules, where each module is responsible for a specific piece of the program's functionality|modular]] knowledge that can be understood independently and recombined in various ways, forming a flexible and interconnected [[202508311142 A graph is a non-linear data structure composed of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that represent connections between these vertices|network]] of thoughts.

This principle is like organizing a kitchen pantry. Instead of keeping a large, pre-mixed bag of "baking ingredients," you store flour, sugar, and salt in separate, clearly labeled containers. Each ingredient is a self-contained unit, ready to be combined in countless different recipes.

For example, instead of writing one long note about the American Revolution, an atomic approach would create separate notes for "The Stamp Act of 1765," "The Boston Tea Party," and "The role of mercantilism in colonial unrest," each fully explaining its specific topic.
