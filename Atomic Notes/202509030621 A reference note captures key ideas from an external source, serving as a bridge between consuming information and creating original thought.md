# Reference Note

A reference note captures key ideas from an external source, serving as a bridge between consuming information and creating original thought. It is a mix of summarizing concepts in your own words to ensure understanding and collecting direct quotes and highlights to preserve the author's precise language.

Think of it as a field journalist's notebook. For some information, the journalist jots down a summary of an event to capture the gist of what happened. For a crucial eyewitness account, they write down the exact quote verbatim. Both are valid ways to record information from a source, chosen based on the need for interpretation versus precision.

For example, after reading a scientific paper, you might create a reference note that summarizes the study's methodology in your own words but also includes a direct quote of the paper's central hypothesis to capture its exact wording for future citation.
