# Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of identifying and isolating the essential features of a concept or object while deliberately ignoring irrelevant details. It reduces complexity by focusing only on what matters for a specific purpose, creating simplified models or representations.

Think of abstraction like using a subway map. The map doesn't show every building, street, or landmark—it strips away all that visual clutter to show only the subway lines and stations. This simplified version ignores geographic accuracy and architectural details because those aren't essential for navigating the transit system.

For example, when a programmer creates a "User" class in software, they abstract the concept of a user by including only relevant attributes like username and email, while ignoring countless real-world details like hair color, favorite food, or shoe size. This abstraction makes the code manageable and focused on what the application actually needs.
