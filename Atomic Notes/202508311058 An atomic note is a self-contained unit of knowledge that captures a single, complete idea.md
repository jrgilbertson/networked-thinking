# Atomic Note

An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea. The [[202508311127 The principle of atomicity is the practice of breaking information into small, self-contained units, with each unit focused on a single, complete idea|principle of atomicity]] requires that each note is understandable on its own and focuses on one concept, making it a [[202508311132 Modularity is a software design principle that involves dividing a program into separate, independent modules, where each module is responsible for a specific piece of the program's functionality|modular]] building block for more complex knowledge structures.

Think of atomic notes as LEGO bricks. Each brick is a simple, independent unit, but you can combine them in countless ways to build intricate and robust models. A single brick does not represent the whole castle, but it is a fundamental, reusable component of it.

For example, instead of a long note titled "Photosynthesis," you would create separate atomic notes for "Chlorophyll's Role in Light Absorption," "The Calvin Cycle," and "Inputs and Outputs of Photosynthesis." Each note stands alone but can be linked to the others.
