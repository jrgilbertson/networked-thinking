# Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition is the cognitive ability to identify recurring structures, regularities, or relationships across different instances of data or experiences. It involves detecting similarities and organizing information based on shared characteristics, enabling prediction and understanding.

Think of pattern recognition like a musician hearing a chord progression. Even if the progression appears in different keys, tempos, or instruments, the musician recognizes the underlying structure because they've internalized the pattern. The surface details change, but the fundamental relationship between notes remains constant.

For example, a doctor recognizes patterns when diagnosing illness—they notice that fever, cough, and fatigue together suggest influenza because they've seen this combination repeatedly in past patients. This pattern recognition allows them to make accurate diagnoses quickly without needing to investigate every possible illness from scratch each time.
